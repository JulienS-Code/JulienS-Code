## About me 🙋‍♂️
I'm an IT student currently doing a work-linked placement with IDM Group. I have skills in web development and software programming. I'm something of a full-stack developer, developing in languages like HTML/CSS and JS for the front end, as well as PHP/SQL/Python/C and Java for the back end. 

During this academic year I'm going to develop my skills further in C and JavaScript, but also in PHP and Java on the business side.
